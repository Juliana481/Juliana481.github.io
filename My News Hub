    <h1>My Makeup Routine</h1>
    <p>
        I like doing my makeup. I recently found a way that it comes out good every time I do it. For my routine I first moisturize my face, then fill in my brows,then put a primer on my nose, then I put a different primer on the rest of my face while that sets, I fill in  my brows.
    </p>
    <p> After that I put foundation on my forehead and blend. After that is done I put foundation over the rest of my face and blend. After that is done I put concealer under my eyes and blend. After blending I put powder under my eyes and the rest of my face.after all that I put bronzer and blush on my cheeks and contour my nose. After that I bake by putting powder under my bronzer to make a sharp line as well as around my nose and under my eyes to brighten my under eyes. and for the last steps I curl my lashes, put on mascara and lashes and setting spray all over my face to set it in place.
